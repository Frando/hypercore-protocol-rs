# hypercore-protocol in Rust

*Vaporware and first experiments only! I started this in my spare time, might be abandoned or become a proper crate and moved into [datrs](https://github.com/datrs).*

NOTE: This does not yet include the NOISE handshake!
To test against [hypercore](https://github.com/hypercore), use [this PR that allows to disable NOISE](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore/pull/244).
